# VMD Scripts
Please check the official [VMD Script Library](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/script_library/) for a range of useful scripts.

Here, we are collecting other scripts from BcompB members. 
Please add your own scripts that may be useful to others!

**hphobs_hbonds.tcl**  - Two 'proc's are introduced here, *hphobs* to count hydrophobic interactions between two selections and *hbonds* to count H-bond interactions between two selections. They can be used on the VMD command line or in tcl scripts after loading this
